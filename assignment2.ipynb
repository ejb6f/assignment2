        "1.   The paper is about data tidying as a process of data cleaning, and its related steps and procedures.\n",
        "2. The “tidy data standard” aims to facilitate initial exploration and analysis of the data and simplify the development of data analysis tools.\n",
        "3. The first quote means that tidy datasets are very much alike, because they follow similar structures and rules that allow for their analysis and editing to remain consistent. However, the same cannot be said for messy data sets, as unique and different problems will be found among, making them more difficult to tackle and less consistent. The second quote means that for any given dataset, it is easier to describe functional relationships between variables than between rows. This allows people to quickly understand the relationship between rows and columns, despite their respective definitions being a bit more complex to understand.\n",
        "4. Wickham defines values as information (typically numbers or strings) stored in a variable. A variable is defined as a container of all values that measure the same underlying attribute across units. Lastly, an observation is defined as a container of all values measured on the same unit.\n",
        "5. Tidy data is defined as a standard way of mapping the meaning of a dataset to its structure, considering the n how rows, columns and tables are matched up with observations, variables and types. For a dataset to be considered tidy, each variable must form a column, each observation must form a row, and each type of observational unit must form a table.\n",
        "6. The 5 most common problems with messy datasets are having column headers as values instead of  variable names, having multiple variables stored in one column, having variables stored in both rows and columns, having multiple types of observational units stored in the same table, and instances when a single observational unit is stored in multiple tables. The data in table 4 is messy because it carries multiple columns considering different income ranges. Melting a data set involves turning columns into rows to make the dataset more concise.\n",
        "7. Table 11 is considered messy because it carries multiple columns representing the same attribute measurement. Table 12 on the other hand is considered molten because its day columns were turned into rows under date, as they were stacked on top of one another.\n",
        "8. The “chicken-and-egg” problem on tidy data references that if tidy data is only as useful as the tools that work with it, then tidy tools will be inextricably linked to tidy data. This means that the analysis of datasets will become limited to tidy tools, where independently changing data structures or data tools will not improve workflow. Wickham hopes that in the future, others will build on this framework to develop even better data storage strategies and better tools.\n",

        "1. The most recent United States Census gathered data on race based on self-identification, where those who fill out the census may choose to report identifying as one or more race groups, given specific racial groups to check-off or leave unchecked.\n",
        "2. Data on race is gathered by the United States Census as it allows for the creation of statistics about race and the presentation of other estimates by racial groups. In politics and society, this data is extremely important, as it allows for the analysis of disparities among racial groups, therefore bringing to light potential discriminatory issues hurting distinct racial groups. Gaining insight and analytics on this topic is imperative because it reveals trends among races that may benefit some through privilege and oppress others through racism and lack of opportunities. Data quality matters, especially for sensitive information such as race, because it sets forward the accuracy and precision of future analysis, thus, helping strengthen the validity of findings gathered from such data.\n",
        "3. The United States census is a data acquiring process that takes multiple key steps. One that is done very well is its address listing procedure. Here, the Census Bureau compiles a list of addresses across the country, which is then utilized as the basis for sending out census questionnaires. This is an extremely valuable part of the process as it ensures that every residential unit is accounted for, or at least, most of them. By incorporating all residential units, the Census Bureau is able to be inclusive of the United States population by having access to a sample size as big as it can be. This allows for more accurate statistical representation of the United States population, and thus, promotes better quality of data gathering and insights production. The Census Bureau reinforced these principles by a non-response follow-up, involving census workers to conduct in-person interviews at households that do not respond to the initial questionnaire, ultimately allowing for a more inclusive data collection. However, one of the most prominent concerns with the census process is the undercounting of minority groups. Historically, racial minorities, low-income households, immigrants, young children, and the homeless have been underrepresented in the census, resulting in a less inclusive representation of the country’s population. To tackle these obstacles, the Census Bureau should prepare census workers on how to adequately address underrepresentation in the questionnaires by placing their efforts more acutely within areas that have been historically undercounted.\n",
        "4. The census does not ask any questions about gender, sexual orientation, or sex at birth. They however inquire a person’s current sex, with only two options being available: male and female. These options are filled out based on how respondents identify themselves. From a data science perspective, holding a binary measurement simplifies future analyses restricting respondents to only two categories. However, these restrictions may cause political turmoil concerning sex/gender debates, as some people do not conform to the sex binary. Moreover, it restricts users' availability to provide unique inputs, potentially resulting in undercounting.\n",
        "5. The gathering of protected characteristics like sex, gender, sexual identity, or race may be concerning because some people may choose not to disclose such information, resulting in unwanted missing data. A challenge that may arise from such missing data includes the uncertainty and unanswered questions one may have regarding the variable that may have missing values. Without such valuable information, conclusions will become harder to make and analyses concerning this topic would have lower validity.\n",
        "6. Although imputation might be a helpful way to deal with missing data, the values imputed will be estimates or approximations of those missing, therefore decreasing the validity of future analyses done for such datasets.\n"
